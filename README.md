## **Objective**

To find out the top five best selling video game genres across all regions, platforms and publishers.

## **Justification**

By tracking and comparing sales data across genres, stakeholders can identify which genres are the most popular and financially successful. Game development studios can become informed on the market and make effective decisions regarding game development, publishing, and marketing strategies. This helps stakeholders understand the competitive landscape and make decisions to achieve a competitive edge.

## **Steps taken**
**Data integration**
  
  Connected the dataset (CSV file) into Power BI, through Power Query.

**Data cleaning**
  
  Removed unnecessary columns which would not aid analysis including 'Rank'.
  
  Replaced unnecessary abbreviations of some console names, in the 'Platform' column, with the full name of console. Some abbreviations were kept depending on whether the console is commonly referred to in this way, by Gamers and Media.
  
  Removed duplicates.
  
**Visualisations**
  
  Employed the use of appropriate chart types to represent my data accurately and intuitively. These included: Bar Charts, Pie charts and others.
  
  Enabled filters on some charts to only include top five globally selling genres, as it made the visuals relevant to my objective.

Consider establishing partnerships or collaborations with these publishers to leverage their market presence, distribution networks, and marketing expertise.

3. Research target audience preferences: Understand the preferences and demographics of your target audience for each genre. Conduct market research, surveys, or focus groups to gather insights into what features, gameplay mechanics, and themes resonate with players in each genre. This will help in tailoring game development, marketing, and publishing strategies to meet the expectations of the target audience.

4. Adapt to platform preferences: Analyze the platform preferences of players within each genre. For example, certain genres like Action and Shooter might perform better on console platforms, while others like Sports and Platform games could find more success on mobile or PC. Tailor your game development and publishing strategies to align with the platforms that have the highest potential for success within each genre.
